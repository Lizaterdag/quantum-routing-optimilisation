## Brainstorm session March 15 - state representation or other approaches 

[] First step free SWAPs
[] Map while circuit into matrix
[] Map parts of circuit & map into nested loop
[] constraint satisfaction problem (coloring graphs or sudoku)
[] Monte Carlo Tree Search (tic tac toe)
[] Termperal Difference Learning
[] Double Q-Learning
[] Genetic Algorithm

Tips:
- What we did on the board (vector representation etc) in thesis presentation
- What has already been done (monte carlo i.e.)
- Comparisson of what has already been done (monte carlo with others)
- Example for instance with starmon 5 for qubit allocation
