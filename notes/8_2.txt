## 8 February

[] Goal is code for general topology => broad perspective, also other than Quantum Inspire

[] Working on phase IBM transpiler pass
   - Call functions like routing map

[] Improve cost function
[] Literature review
   - What is out there on state representation and cost functions based on SWAP gates

[] Presentation every week

[] Write quantum assembly code for the circuit algorithms
[] run the code with different topologies (Pozzi's algorithm)
[] Reduce the circuit depth overhead

[] Look into deductioin of timesteps, for instance with parallel qubit routing
[] What kind of qubit inhabits compute faster with what kind of gates
[] What can we take into account:
   - These gates interact faster with eachother (ask hardware team)

[] Look for a better state representation
[] Tutorial on how HPC works
