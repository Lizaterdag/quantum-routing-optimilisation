#### Summary: Main Goal is initial placement procedure optimization

[] Remove deprecaded files and stuff
[] Change readme file (perhaps a blokschema with explanation)
[] Adding comments to the code and creating an ERD of the code
[] Think of an example to explain everything, like a toymodel with what is the action, reward and state
[] Explain to Machine Learning team the problem and receive feedback
[] Optimizing initial placement procedure e.g. my own placement code
[] Perhaps different annealers to see if runtime improves -> Check the impace, perhaps better quality
[] compare state-of-the-art depth overhead or placement
