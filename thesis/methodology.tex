 No. & Guidelines & Compliance \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
 1 & Design science research must produce a workable, practical artefact in the form of a construct, model, method, or instantiation & It can be used according to the original purpose, by the intended users. Be careful not to over promise. Be careful to promise the right things.\\
 \hline
 2 & Ensure that the artefact produced is relevant and important & Has anyone tried to solve it before? Why hasn't it been solved before? How important can it be? Is it too difficult?\\
 \hline
 3 & Rigorously evaluate the artefact produced & How do you know you accomplished what you wanted? Don't just ask people if they like it. Analytically using a mathematical model. Empirically using field study or experiment  \\
 \hline
 4 & Produce an artefact that makes a research contribution. & Solve a previously unsolved problem. Show that an artefact can be produced when it was previously unclear that this is possible.\\
 \hline
 5 & Follow rigorous construction methods. & The method must be rigorous and replicable  \\ 
 \hline
 6 & Show the artefact is the outcome of a search process & This is done after you're finished \\
 \hline
 7 & Clearly communicate the research process and outcome & Say a little about your thesis, any conference papers planned \\[1ex]

This is an example of how you can cross reference anything marked with a label \ref{chap:intro}


\section{Experimental design}
What was your design, how did you select subjects/participants

\subsection{Threats to validity}

\section{Analytical study}

Did you derive your results through mathematical proof?
How do you know it is correct? Will it generalise to a class of problems?

\subsection{Case Study}

Did you do a case study?
